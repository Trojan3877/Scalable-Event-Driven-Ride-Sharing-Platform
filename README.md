# 🚗 Scalable Event-Driven Ride Sharing Platform

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **highly scalable, event-driven ride-sharing platform** inspired by systems like Uber and Lyft.

It demonstrates:
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven communication (Kafka-style)
- Distributed system design
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker)
- Scalability and fault-tolerant patterns

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

### Core Components
- **API Gateway** – Entry point for all client requests
- **Rider Service** – Handles ride requests
- **Driver Service** – Manages driver availability
- **Matching Service** – Matches riders with drivers
- **Trip Service** – Tracks trip lifecycle
- **Pricing Service** – Calculates fare dynamically
- **Payment Service** – Handles transactions
- **Notification Service** – Sends updates to users

### Communication Model
- Event-driven via message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ style)
- Services are loosely coupled and independently scalable

---

## 🔄 Event Flow

```text
ride.requested → matching-service  
driver.matched → trip-service  
trip.started → pricing-service  
trip.completed → payment-service  
payment.processed → notification-service

🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

This project demonstrates:

Real-world distributed system design
Production-level architecture thinking
Scalability and fault tolerance
Strong backend + infrastructure knowledge


## ❓ Why did you build this system?

This project was built to simulate a real-world ride-sharing platform using modern distributed system principles. The goal was to demonstrate how large-scale systems handle high concurrency, real-time decision-making, and fault tolerance using microservices and event-driven architecture.

---

## ❓ What problem does this system solve?

Traditional monolithic systems struggle with scalability and resilience. This system solves that by:

- Decoupling services using events  
- Enabling independent scaling of components  
- Reducing system-wide failures  
- Supporting real-time matching between riders and drivers  

---

## ❓ Why choose an event-driven architecture?

Event-driven systems provide:

- Loose coupling between services  
- Asynchronous communication  
- Improved scalability under high load  
- Better fault isolation  

This is critical for systems where real-time updates (like driver matching) must happen quickly and reliably.

---

## ❓ How does the system work end-to-end?

1. Rider requests a ride  
2. Event (`ride.requested`) is published  
3. Matching service consumes the event and finds a driver  
4. `driver.matched` event is emitted  
5. Trip service starts tracking the ride  
6. Pricing service calculates fare dynamically  
7. Payment service processes transaction  
8. Notification service informs user  

---

## ❓ Why split the system into multiple services?

Each service represents a **bounded context**:

- Rider service → user interactions  
- Driver service → driver availability  
- Matching service → core business logic  
- Payment service → financial transactions  

This allows:
- Independent scaling  
- Faster development cycles  
- Better fault isolation  

---

## ❓ How does the system scale?

The system scales using:

- Stateless microservices  
- Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes  
- Event partitioning in Kafka  
- Load balancing at the API gateway  

Each service can scale independently based on demand.

---

## ❓ How are failures handled?

Failure handling includes:

- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff  
- Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for failed events  
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures  
- Idempotent processing to avoid duplication  

---

## ❓ How do you ensure data consistency?

The system uses **eventual consistency**:

- Events are the source of truth  
- Services update their own databases independently  
- Consistency is achieved over time rather than instantly  

---

## ❓ What are the biggest engineering challenges?

- Handling high concurrency (thousands of ride requests)  
- Designing low-latency matching algorithms  
- Avoiding duplicate or out-of-order events  
- Maintaining consistency across services  
- Ensuring fault tolerance  

---

## ❓ How would you improve the matching system?

Future improvements could include:

- Geospatial indexing (e.g., quadtrees, geohashing)  
- Machine learning-based driver matching  
- Real-time traffic and demand prediction  
- Dynamic surge pricing models  

---

## ❓ Why not use synchronous REST calls between services?

Synchronous systems:

- Increase latency  
- Create tight coupling  
- Fail more easily under load  

Event-driven systems allow services to operate independently and asynchronously.



## ❓ How is performance optimized?

- Event batching and partitioning  
- Efficient in-memory processing  
- Minimal synchronous dependencies  
- Horizontal scaling  



## ❓ What role does the API Gateway play?

The API Gateway:

- Routes incoming requests  
- Handles authentication  
- Aggregates responses  
- Provides a unified entry point  



## ❓ How does this compare to real-world systems?

This architecture mirrors systems used by:

- Uber  
- Lyft  
- DoorDash  

These companies use:
- Event-driven microservices  
- Distributed data systems  
- Real-time matching engines  



## ❓ What did you learn from building this?

- Designing scalable distributed systems  
- Tradeoffs between consistency and availability  
- Event-driven communication patterns  
- Infrastructure orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)  



## ❓ Who would use this system?

- Ride-sharing companies  
- Logistics and delivery platforms  
- Real-time marketplace applications  
- Mobility startups  



## ❓ What makes this project stand out?

- Combines backend + distributed systems + infra  
- Demonstrates real-world scalability patterns  
- Goes beyond CRUD apps into system design  
- Shows production-level thinking  



## ❓ How would this perform in production?

With proper infrastructure:

- Handles high request volume  
- Scales horizontally  
- Maintains low latency  
- Recovers from failures gracefully  



## ❓ How does this relate to AI/ML systems?

Event-driven systems are foundational for:

- Real-time ML inference pipelines  
- Recommendation systems  
- Demand prediction models  

This platform can easily integrate ML components for:
- Ride demand forecasting  
- Driver matching optimization  
- Pricing strategies
