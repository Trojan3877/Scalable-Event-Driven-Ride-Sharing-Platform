# Scalable-Event-Driven-Ride-Sharing-Platform
System Design architecture for ride-sharing platform
# Scalable Event Ride Sharing Platform 🚗📍

## Overview
This project is a scalable event-based ride-sharing platform built to handle high traffic scenarios like concerts, sports games, and conferences. It allows users to request rides, find matches based on proximity and event timing, and supports real-time updates, geolocation, and dynamic pricing. The system is designed using microservices, cloud-native principles, and high-availability architecture to ensure performance under heavy load.

## Features
- 🎫 Event-based ride coordination
- 📍 Real-time location matching
- 💬 Chat system between drivers and riders
- ⚙️ Dynamic pricing model
- 🧠 Optional AI/ML module for route optimization and ETA prediction
- ☁️ Scalable architecture using Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services
- 🔐 Authentication and authorization using OAuth2.0 or JWT
- 📊 Analytics dashboard for admins (rides, congestion heatmaps, etc.)
