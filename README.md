## Overview

This project implements a **Scalable, Event-Driven Architecture** for a next-gen ride-sharing platform.

Core components:
✅ Microservices architecture  
✅ Event-driven messaging (Kafka)  
✅ Real-time driver & rider matching  
✅ Scalable system design

---

## Business Impact

Modern ride-sharing platforms demand:
- **Real-time event processing**  
- **High availability & fault tolerance**  
- **Scalable architecture for peak loads**  

This project demonstrates the architecture of an **industry-grade mobility platform**.
